IOT based Smart Weather Reporting System

Project Domain / Category:
    Automation / Embedded System Programming

Abstract / Introduction:
    In the present days automated systems or embedded systems have fewer manual 
actions. They are much more flexible, reliable and much accurate as compared to 
our manual systems. Due to increase in demand of such reliable and flexible 
systems, we prefer an automated control system. 

    Here we propose a smart weather reporting system over the internet. Our 
proposed system allows for weather parameter reporting over the internet. It 
allows the people to directly check the weather stats online without the need 
of a weather forecasting agency. 

    Our System uses temperature, humidity as well as rain sensor to monitor 
weather and provide live reporting of the weather statistics. System must have 
the capability to have location-based information so one can use any mapping 
mechanism to elaborate/display these weather conditions based on GPS module. 
The system constantly monitors temperature using temperature sensor, humidity 
using humidity sensor and for rain. 

    The system constantly transmits this data to the processing unit, which now 
processes this data and keeps on transmitting it to the online web server & 
mobile application. This data is live updated to be viewed on the online server 
system. Also, system allows user to set alerts for instances, the system 
provides alerts to user if the weather parameters cross those values. 

    Thus, the IOT based weather reporting system provides an efficient 
internet-based weather reporting system for users.
